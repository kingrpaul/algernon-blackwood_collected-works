			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>My old tunes are rather broken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they come from far away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bringing just a little token</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of a long forgotten day;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When the children came to listen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’oth-er side the garden fence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my heart leapt out of prison,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the gift⁠—of seven pence!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Just beyond the haystack’s shadow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Long a-go that leafy June,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How they danced about the meadow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the ris-in’ of the moon!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>While from out a railway carriage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Standing ready and alight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stepped their guests as to a marriage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Asked to dine⁠—and stay the night!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sweep and Laugher danced to-geth-er,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a man who had a lamp</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Capered lightly as a feather</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With à lazy looking tramp;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When a voice disturbed the Lancers:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Children, come, it’s time for bed”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Railway carriages, Sprites and Dancers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Flew up⁠—to the stars instead!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now I am a Con-stel-la-tion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Free from ev-’ry earthly care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Playing nightly at my station</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the Big and Little Bear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But my tunes are still en-tranc-ing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As that night in leafy June,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I caught the children dancing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the Sprites beneath the moon!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Still the children come to hear me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the lane or dingy street;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still the heavy pavement near me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Flutters to their happy feet;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For my tunes are ne’er forgotten,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they bring the scent of musk;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grown up folk may call ’em rotten,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I’m looked⁠—for when it’s dusk!</span>
				</p>
