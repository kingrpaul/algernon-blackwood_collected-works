			<h2 epub:type="title">Questions and Answers</h2>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<p>
					<span>No one quite tells me what I want to know;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They answer me—and that's the end of that.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if I ask, "What makes a flower grow?"</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their answer wouldn't satisfy the cat!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>If I say: “Daddy, why should snow be white</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fall in crystals, no one like the other?"</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He mumbles gruffly, while he strikes a light:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I’m busy, Tommy. Run and ask your Mother!"</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Mother, when I ask why cuckoos cuck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just stares at me and says: “God made them so,"</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gives me such a wise and solemn look,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which means, of course, she really doesn't know.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And Nannie's way is diff'rent altogether,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if I ask why winter days get colder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She gives a grunt and says: “Oh, it's just weather.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You'll understand all that when you grow older!"</span>
